"""
Production-Ready Leave Type Initialization Service

WHY THIS EXISTS:
--------------
In production (Render, Railway, Fly.io), databases start fresh on deploy.
Without automatic initialization:
- Leave types table is empty
- Frontend shows empty dropdowns
- Users cannot create leave requests
- Manual database seeding is error-prone and not scalable

This service automatically seeds default leave types on application startup
for any organization that doesn't have them yet.

DESIGN PRINCIPLES:
-----------------
1. IDEMPOTENT: Safe to run multiple times - never creates duplicates
2. ORGANIZATION-AWARE: Respects multi-tenant isolation
3. TRANSACTIONAL: Atomic operations with rollback on failure
4. SAFE ON REDEPLOY: Checks existing data before inserting
5. NO MANUAL SCRIPTS: Runs automatically via FastAPI lifespan
6. PRODUCTION-READY: Comprehensive logging and error handling

GUARANTEES:
----------
✅ Never creates duplicate leave types
✅ Only seeds organizations without existing types
✅ Rolls back on any error to prevent partial state
✅ Works reliably across all cloud providers
✅ Logs all operations for debugging

def seed_default_leave_types() -> None:
    """
    Initialize default leave types for all organizations.
    
    This function is called automatically during FastAPI application startup
    via the lifespan event in main.py.
    
    BEHAVIOR:
    ---------
    1. Queries all organizations in the database
    2. For each organization:
       a. Checks if leave types already exist
       b. If no leave types exist, seeds the default types
       c. Commits the transaction atomically
    3. Logs all operations for production debugging
    
    IDEMPOTENCY:
    -----------
    This function is safe to call multiple times:
    - Checks existing leave types before insertion
    - Never creates duplicates
    - Skips organizations that already have leave types
    
    ERROR HANDLING:
    --------------
    - Uses database transactions with automatic rollback
    - Logs all errors with organization context
    - Continues processing other organizations if one fails
    - Never leaves the database in a partial state
    
    PRODUCTION LOGGING:
    ------------------
    - INFO: Successful operations (seeding completed)
    - DEBUG: Skip operations (already has types)
    - ERROR: Failed operations with full traceback
    
    Returns:
        None
        
    Raises:
        Does not raise - all errors are caught and logged
